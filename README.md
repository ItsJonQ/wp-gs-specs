# WP Global Styles - Specs

This repo contains a collection of technical specs which break down the concepts originally proposed on the [Gutenberg Github Repo](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/19611#issuecomment-577408511).

The entire Global Style system has many moving parts. By breaking down the spec, we can more effectively identify, outline, and communicate the various mechanics involved.

Once the specs are written, they will be shared on Gutenberg's repo as [new issues](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/new/choose).
